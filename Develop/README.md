## Description

In this project I used node.js and Inquirer to create a template for a README. This is a backend project so it will not be deployed on gitHub.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation
Inquirer was installed to use this project


## Usage


In this project the User which will be me will open the terminal. Once the terminal is opened node index is typed in It will start the array of questions. The User will answer the questions which will be filed under the specific heading. Once all the questions are answered a new README.md file will be generated
